# Hybrid-Contrastive-Pix2pix
we propose a Hybrid Contrastive Pix2pix architecture that integrates the PatchNCE loss from Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT) into a paired training regime.
Our code is built upon the official PyTorch implementations of CUT (https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation) and Pix2pix (https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).
